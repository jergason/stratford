# The Stratford Times
Shakespeare has been getting a lot of reviews recently about his plays. So far he has managed to build a backend API to serve them, but he doesn't have the chops to finish out the UI. That's where you come in, your task is to build a client side app for Shakespeare's API. The design of the application is up to you.

## Installation
